# Weekly Code Repository

This repository contains the daily coding exercises, solutions, and learning materials that I work on. The codes span across various topics like DSA, algorithms, and other programming challenges.

## Prerequisites

Before running or contributing to the repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Programming Language(s):** (e.g., Python, Java)
  - Installation guides:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

- **Google Colab:**  
  For convenience, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run and share your Python notebooks without installing anything locally. It’s especially useful for collaborative work.

- **Libraries/Packages:**  
  You might need to install some additional libraries depending on the language or project. For example, in Python:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-code-repo.git
